# Running the app

You can run the app with docker compose through the command: 
`docker compose up`.

You can then access the main application at localhost:80 (or simply localhost).

Phpmyadmin is also configured to run on port 8080, so localhost:8080, you can access it using root and the password can be found and changed in the docker-compose.yaml file (line 25 and line 16).
